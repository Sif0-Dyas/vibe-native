# Vibedentify — User Guide

Vibedentify listens to your tracks and tells you their **genre, BPM, and key**, then lets you explore your whole collection as an interactive **map of sound**. It's built for DJs, producers, and collectors who want to understand and organize a library fast.

Everything runs on your own machine: **your audio never leaves the computer, and your files are never changed** — analyzing only reads them.

*Just want to install or run it? See the [README](../README.md). This guide is about* using *the app.*

## 1. Getting started

The app has two tabs at the top:

- **≣ List** — the analyzer. Drop tracks in and read their genre / BPM / key.
- **✷ Map** — a 3-D "constellation" of everything you've analyzed, for exploring by sound.

**To try it right now:** stay on **List** and drag an audio file anywhere onto the window. In a second or two you'll see its genre, tempo, key, and a colored waveform. That's the whole loop — analyze on List, explore on Map.

**A quick mental model.** Vibedentify doesn't slap one label on a track. It listens *moment by moment* across the whole song, guessing the genre continuously, then summarizes those guesses into an overall read. That single idea explains a lot of the app: the **waveform** shows the moment-by-moment guesses, the **genre breakdown** shows the summary, and the **lenses** (section 5) let you change how that summary is formed — all instantly, without re-listening to the audio.

---

## 2. Adding your music — and which method to use

There are two ways to get tracks into the analyzer. They do the same analysis; they differ in scale.

### Drag & drop / Browse files

Drag any number of files onto the List window, or click **⊕ Browse files…**. Supported formats: MP3, FLAC, WAV, M4A, OGG, AIFF, and more. Tracks are processed one at a time; each row appears immediately and fills in when it's done.

> **Use this when** you're checking a handful of tracks, testing a new download, or just poking around. It's the everyday method.

### Batch folder

Click **⊕ batch folder** and give it the path to a folder of music. It scans that folder (and everything inside it) and analyzes every track it finds, several at a time, showing a running `done / total` count.

> **Use this when** you want to bring in a whole library or crate at once — it's noticeably faster than dropping files one by one, and you can walk away while it runs.

**Either way, nothing is ever analyzed twice.** If a track has been analyzed before — this session or months ago — the result comes back instantly instead of being recomputed. So re-scanning a folder only spends time on what's new, and re-dropping a file you already have just skips it.

---

## 3. Reading a track

Each analyzed row shows three things:

- **Track** — the title with a **genre-colored waveform** underneath. The colors come from the moment-by-moment genre guesses, so you can literally *see* where a track changes character — an ambient intro, a drop, a half-time breakdown. Hover the waveform to magnify it; click anywhere on it to **play and seek** from that point. **Shift-drag** a time range to **override that section as a genre** — it repaints in the override style and the extracted clip is saved into that genre's training folder (needs a track added from a folder/batch, not a browser-dropped file). To undo one, **shift-click** its span and confirm **remove** (this also deletes the extracted clip).
- **BPM / Key** — the tempo and musical key. The key is shown in **Camelot** notation (like `8A`), the wheel DJs use for harmonic mixing, alongside the plain key.
- **Genre** — the breakdown: the dominant genre(s) and their share of the track, tagged with the broad **family** they belong to (House, Trance, Bass Music, …). If a read looks shaky, you may also see a **⚠ "sounds like …"** hint suggesting a better fit (see section 6).

Every analyzed track also has a built-in **preview player** — play and scrub it right from its waveform.

---

## 4. Two deeper looks: Refine & Compare

These are optional, on-demand tools you run on a single track when the normal read isn't enough. You'll find both on each row.

### fine (Refine) — for tracks that change mid-song

Click **fine** to re-analyze that one track at much higher time resolution. The normal read looks at the track in coarse chunks; **fine** looks at it in fine slices, so brief genre shifts stop getting smeared together.

> **Use this when** a track clearly moves between styles — a DnB tune with a half-time breakdown, an intro in a totally different vibe — and you want to see exactly where those switches happen. (It costs more compute, which is why it's on demand.)

### ⚖ compare engines — a second opinion

Click **⚖ compare engines** to run a *second*, different AI model alongside the default one and see both reads plus a blend, with a live **slider** between them.

> **Use this when** a genre read looks off and you want a tie-breaker. If both models agree, trust it. If they disagree, the track is genuinely ambiguous — which is useful to know on its own. (The second model is slower, so it only runs when you ask.)

---

## 5. How the genre is decided — the lens system

Because the genre read is a *summary* of moment-by-moment guesses, there's no single "correct" way to summarize — it depends on what you care about. **Lenses** let you switch between summaries instantly (nothing is re-analyzed). Set a default in the header; any single row can use a different lens on its own (marked with a `*`).

There are two lenses.

### Identity lens — "what genre *is* this track?"

This decides the overall label.

- **v2 · salience** *(default)* — weights the loud, confident, recurring parts of the track more than a brief or quiet moment. **Pick this** for the most "human" answer — a track whose drops are Dubstep reads as Dubstep even if the intro is Ambient.
- **v1 · flat %** — just counts how much of the track (by time) each genre wins. **Pick this** if you want a simpler, more literal split that treats a quiet intro the same as the main section.

### Segmentation lens — "what plays *when*?"

This controls how the **waveform** is colored — how the moment-by-moment stream is grouped into visible sections.

- **raw** — every instant's single top genre. Most detailed, but flickers between near-identical labels.
- **hysteresis** *(default)* — sticks with the current genre until a challenger clearly wins for a while. Kills the flicker and shows real sections. A good everyday choice.
- **sibling-merge** — first pools near-synonyms (Deep House / Tech House / Bassline → House) so cousins don't fight. The groups are **editable** via the **siblings ⚙** button.
- **family** — rolls everything up to broad families (House, Trance, Techno, Bass Music, …). The coarsest, big-picture view.
- **hyst + sibling** — sibling-merge *and* hysteresis together: grouped and smoothed. The cleanest read of a track's structure.

> **Rule of thumb:** leave both on their defaults (salience + hysteresis) for normal use. Reach for **family** or **sibling-merge** when the raw genres feel too granular, and **raw** or **fine** (section 4) when you want maximum detail.

Very minor genres in the stream collapse into a single grey **"Other"** bucket so the picture stays readable.

## 6. Fixing & organizing your library

Per-track actions live on each row (and many are repeated in the Map popup); library-wide tools sit in the footer.

- **✎ override** — set the genre yourself (say your own *Riddim* or *Tearout*). Your choice **sticks everywhere and survives reloads** — it becomes the track's genre on the List, the Map, and exports, and re-adding the file later keeps your label instead of the model's. (It also copies the track into `~/genre_training/<genre>/` — those folders are the training set for a **custom genre head**: once you've labelled enough tracks, the scripts in `training/` can train a model that adds your own genres as a **custom** row in each read. See *Training custom genres* in the README.) The same override is on the **Map popup** and behaves identically. To undo one, **omit** the track and re-scan it.
- **✕ omit** — remove a track's analysis (for a bogus read you don't want cluttering things). It disappears from the List and the Map. **Your audio file is untouched** — re-scanning brings it back fresh.
- **Tags** — attach your own labels ("high energy", "opener", "peak time") to tracks for your own organization.
- **◈ vibes** — build a **playlist by feel**. Add a few tracks to a vibe and it gathers everything else in your library that *sounds* similar, ranked by closeness. You can 👍/👎 individual tracks to steer the vibe toward or away from examples.
- **⚠ review reads** *(footer)* — a one-click sweep for likely mistakes. The app flags reads it's unsure about — specifically, a low-confidence label whose closest-sounding neighbors strongly disagree (the classic "a bass track got called K-pop" case). The panel lists every flagged track with its suggested fix, plus buttons to jump to it on the Map or omit it. It only ever **flags and suggests** — it never changes a genre on its own.
- **Clear list** empties the on-screen list (without deleting any analysis); **Export .txt** dumps the current list (genre, BPM, key, duration) to a text file.

## 7. Exploring the Map

The **✷ Map** tab plots your entire analyzed library in 3-D. **Tracks that sound alike sit near each other**, faint lines connect each track to its closest sonic neighbors, and color = genre family. It's the fun part — a birds-eye view of your whole collection.

### Three layouts — and which to use

Switch between them with the buttons at the top. They answer different questions:

- **◎ regions** *(default)* — organized by genre: each family forms its own cluster, and within a family tracks group by subgenre (Dubstep and Drum n Bass sit apart). As you zoom in, big family labels give way to subgenre labels. **Use this to** see your library laid out by genre and find where a style lives.
- **✦ galaxy** — no genre grouping at all; position is *pure* sonic similarity, so clusters form naturally from how tracks actually sound. **Use this to** discover surprising neighbors and natural groupings the genre labels miss.
- **⊢ tree** — your library as a branching **taxonomy**: root → families → subgenres, with bigger branches for the parts of your collection you have more of. **Use this to** understand the make-up of your library at a glance (hover a branch to reveal its track count).

**At a glance** — the same library, arranged three ways:

```
◎ REGIONS  —  arranged by GENRE
     ·House·                ·Techno·
   ····                          ····
        ·····Bass Music·····
   ·Trance·                 ·Chill-out·
   -> each genre is its own cluster;
      subgenres form patches inside it.
      "where does a genre live?"

✦ GALAXY  —  arranged by SOUND
            ····  ·····  ··
        ··························
        ····· ··············· ····
            ····  ······  ···
   -> one blob; a track's position is
      pure sonic similarity, not label.
      "what actually sounds alike?"

⊢ TREE  —  the HIERARCHY / proportions
   root ─┬─ Bass Music ─┬─ Dubstep
         │              └─ Drum n Bass
         ├─ House ──────┬─ Deep House
         │              └─ Bassline
         └─ Techno ───── …
   -> a branching taxonomy; longer
      branches = more tracks.
      "what's the make-up of my library?"
```

Regions and galaxy are the explorable 3-D point clouds (drag to orbit, click a genre to fly in); tree is a flat 2-D diagram of the structure.

### Getting around

You can **orbit** (rotate), **pan** (slide), and **zoom** independently. A small **nav legend in the top-left corner** always lists the controls (click its header to collapse it):

- **Mouse:** left-drag orbits · right-drag / middle-drag / **Shift + left-drag** pans · scroll zooms into wherever you point.
- **Keyboard:** **W / S** zoom in / out · **A / D** orbit left / right · **arrow keys** pan · `+` / `-` also zoom · `space` play/pause the spin · `f` fit · `esc` close a popup.
- The map gently **auto-spins**; the **⏸ / ▶ button** (next to the speed slider) or `space` pauses it, and the **↻ slider** sets the speed.

### Selecting a track

**Click any dot** (or use the **Search** box to fly to one). The view re-centers to orbit around it, and a popup opens with: its genre family, tempo, key, and other reads it was close to ("also reads as"); **similar artists** and **similar tracks** pulled from across your library; a **🎲 "a match for you"** suggestion (with a re-roll) — a quick way to surface something you forgot you had; and **✎ override** / **✕ omit** buttons (same as the List).

### Map controls

- **Search** — jump to any track, artist, or genre.
- **Click a genre or subgenre name** — on the map, or in the legend — to fly to that cluster and orbit around it (subgenres zoom in a little tighter than their overarching genre).
- **🎧 harmonic** — highlight what you could mix next (see section 8).
- **≈ edges** — show or hide the connecting lines.
- **Genre legend** *(bottom-left, collapsible)* — groups each **overarching genre** with its **subgenres** beneath it (in their shade colors), so you can see the hierarchy. Click a genre or subgenre **name** to fly to it; click a genre's **color dot** to recolor it (your colors are remembered).
- **Genre filter** *(top-bar dropdown)* — show just one genre, or just the **⚠ likely misreads**.
- **fit** — reset the view and clear any filter.

Each track's dot is a **shade of its genre's color** keyed to its subgenre, and leans toward its second-closest genre's color — so a big cluster visibly shows the subgenres inside it, and tracks that sit between two genres get a blended, in-between color.

You can also share a view: the address bar updates as you go (`#map`, `#galaxy`, `#review`), so those links reopen the same place.

## 8. Harmonic mixing (for DJs)

On the Map, select a track and turn on **🎧 harmonic**. Vibedentify rings every track that would mix smoothly with it — matching **key** (neighbors on the Camelot wheel, or the relative major/minor) **and tempo** (within about ±6%, or at half/double time) — and dims everything else.

It turns the Map into a "what can I play next?" tool: pick a track, flip harmonic on, and your compatible options light up across the whole library.

---

## 9. Good to know

- **Your files are safe.** Analyzing only reads your audio; it's never modified or moved, and nothing is uploaded anywhere — it all stays on your machine.
- **Nothing is analyzed twice.** Results are remembered by the audio itself, so the same track returns instantly even if you rename or move the file, and re-scanning a big folder only works on what's new.
- **The list is temporary; your library is permanent.** Reloading the page clears the on-screen List, but every analysis is saved — it's all still on the Map, and re-dropping files repopulates the List instantly from memory.
- **Very large libraries:** the List can get heavy past a few thousand rows (each keeps a waveform), so for big collections lean on **batch folder** to bring them in and the **Map** to explore them.
