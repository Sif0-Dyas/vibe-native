// ESLint flat config for the static frontend JS.
//
// The frontend ships as plain <script>-loaded files (app.js -> player.js ->
// map.js) that share ONE global scope -- not ES modules. So a function defined
// in one file and called from another is a normal cross-file reference, which
// ESLint (linting each file in isolation) would otherwise flag as no-undef.
// Rather than silence no-undef, the names that are genuinely shared across the
// files are declared as globals below (grep the files to maintain the list) --
// that way a REAL cross-file typo/rename (the failure mode of the split) still
// trips no-undef, while the legitimate shared surface is documented here.
//
// Scope: correctness only (no-undef, no-unused-vars). No stylistic rules --
// ruff owns Python style and there's no appetite for a JS style war here.
