"""Smoke test for the custom-genre training pipeline (training/train_head.py).

Runs in-process on tiny synthetic data -- no models, no audio on disk. There is
deliberately NO test for training/embed_extract.py: it runs real audio through
the Essentia EffNet embedder, which -- like analysis.py's real-analysis path --
can't run in CI (the suite runs in FAKE_ANALYZER mode with no models), so it
stays out of the suite by the same convention.
